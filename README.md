# Challenge-2-Portfolio

## Description

What did I make a Portfolio?

- I wanted to create a Portfolio to introduce myself to possible future employers. I also included work that I created to show off what I have done and what I am capable of. 

What did I include in my Porfolio? 

- I added an "About Me" section that includes info about my life and what i enjoy doing and what I hope to accomplish one day.
- I added links to sections inside my portfolio  that will bring you directly to that section. I hope to touch it up throughout this program and beyond. 
- I created a link in my "Work" section that is a linked to my first applicaton that I worked on. I plan on adding more links to my projects that are being worked on. 
- I have a "Resume" section that I plan on adding a downloadable link to my resume for any future employer. I currently have placeholder for my Linkedin page.
- In my "Contact" section I added links for my email, phone number, Github and my Linkedin. You can use these to contact me at anytime.
